"Your" is a possessive adjective indicating ownership (e.g., "your car"). "You're" is a contraction of "you are" (e.g., "you're going"). A simple test is to replace the word with "you are"; if the sentence still makes sense, use "you're". They are homophones, meaning they sound the same but have different meanings. 
Key Differences:
Your (Possessive): Used to show that something belongs to the person you are addressing. It is always followed by a noun.
You're (Contraction): Short for "you are". It is often followed by a verb ending in -ing or an adjective. 
Examples:
Correct: I like your shoes. (Possession)
Correct: You're going to be late. (You are)
Incorrect: You're dog is barking. (Contraction used for possession)
Correct: Your dog is barking. (Possession)
